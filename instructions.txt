Using a web stack of your choice create a small web application to answer the following question:

If all the integers between 1 and 123 are spelled out in English with no spaces or conjunctions and compiled into a single string, answer these questions once:
    1) what is the total length of the string
    2) if a letter was selected at random from the string, what is the empirical probability it will be letter 'e'. ?

e.g the number 101 would be: "onehundredone"

Build this into a web application that has at least an input box to receive a letter, 
and some output view to show the probability of that letter (as opposed to 'e' above). 
The goal of the web app, beyond answering the questions above, 
is to provide you an opportunity to showcase your ability to create something is functional and beautiful on the web. 
Do as much as you can with it. Please push your code to a public repository on github. 
Feel free to host the site somewhere as a demonstration, or provide instructions for running the project in a development environment. 
It will be judged on code cleanliness, accuracy, and UI (in that order).

1. Length of the string is 1235
2. (# of occurrences of "e") / 1235
